# Max-Subarray-Using-Divide-and-Conquer
Find Max Subarray using Divide and Conquer Approach

Implement the pseudo algorithm of the Find Maximum Subarray problem using a divide and conquer approach in finding the contiguous subarray whose values have the largest sum. Given the input and output requirements, your implement should follow the pseudocode provided in the textbook/lecture. You can simulate a period of 100 days with a randomly generated price ranging from $50 to $120 and calculate daily changes in prices from the generated prices.
