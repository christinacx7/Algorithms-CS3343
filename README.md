# Rod-Cutting-Problem
Implement two versions of the pseudo algorithm of the Rod Cutting problem

Implement two versions of the pseudo algorithm of the Rod Cutting problem in a programming language you are familiar with and compare the effinciency of those in terms of the number of recursive calls made in the recurisve top-down implementation and the number of iterations for the recursive bottom-up implementation. Implement should follow the pseudocode provided in the textbook/lecture and use a table below as a model for sample prices with p_i dollars of revenue for the length i. You may define p_i dollars with more lengths.
