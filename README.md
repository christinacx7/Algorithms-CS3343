# Priority-Queue-Using-Max-Heap
Priority Queue psuedo algorithm using max-heap written in python.

Implement the pseudo algorithm of Priority Queue in Java/C/C++/Python (programming language you are familiar with). Randomly generate 100 integers between 0 and 500. Each generated number acts as a key (priority) to make a max-heap. Display the numbers in the array (this represents a max-heap for the priority queue). Test the priority queue by extracting a max number (key) from the heap. Display the numbers in the array again (this time the max number is removed from the heap and the remaining 99 numbers will be displayed in a reorganized max-heap.) Your implement should follow the pseudocode provided in the textbook/lecture and use your variables in the implementation. Each must be a separate method.
